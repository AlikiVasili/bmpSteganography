The program bmpSteganography is a library that contains various functions to edit a bmp image
file. There are functions to list a bmp photos header, apply a grayscale filter, encrypt and decrypt a bmp image inside another bmp image, encrypt and decrypt text inside a bmp image, tranform a text into a bmp image and the image back to a text.

This homework was very exciting and engaging. For the first time the result's of our code
are more than some messages printed on the console. It was also very helpful in our understanding of binary files.
